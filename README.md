## Technical installation


### Pre-requisites


Cloud Armor is a security service that is running in the Google Cloud Global Load-Balancer (GLB), logs are created inside the GLB logs in Cloud Logging.


For the Block to work, you will need to :

- Create a BigQuery Dataset
- Create a Service Account for Looker to access the Dataset
- Assign IAM role “BigQuery Data Viewer” & “BigQuery Job User” to the Service Account for this project
- Create a Log router sink in Cloud Logging, where Sink destination is the BigQuery Dataset that you created and using this filter to include Cloud Armor Logs from the GLB logs: “resource.type:(http_load_balancer) AND jsonPayload.enforcedSecurityPolicy.name:(“$CLOUD_ARMOR_POLICY_NAME”)”

You might need to add additional policy in your Log sink filter in order to capture all of your Cloud Armor policies.


### Installation steps

Install this block from the marketplace

Required installation parameters:
**CONNECTION_NAME**: name of the database connection for the Cloud Armor dataset in BigQuery
**DATASET_NAME**: the [project.dataset] in BigQuery where Cloud Armor data is stored

Access the block from Browse - Applications & Tools - Google Cloud Armor Block or the LookML dashboards folder (/folders/lookml). You can customize these dashboards by copying them into one of your instance folders.
